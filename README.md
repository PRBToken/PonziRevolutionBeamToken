PonziRevolutionBeam(PRB) token - ERC20


PRB token is a standard ERC-20 token.
PRB token made for fun, and distributed to several Korean users.

Why was PRB token born?
- To educate people how it is so easy to make ERC-20 token
- To warn scam ICOs
- PRB token was born by "non"-programmer. (Me!)
- Anyone can make ERC-20 token in one hour: use the keyword on google -> "how to make a ERC-20 token?"

What does PRB token do?
- PRB token does nothing. Yes, literally "nothing".
- This is garbage on Ethereum network.
- While PRB token should have no value at all, but you can still buy and keep it.

You can find PRB token on etherscan.io

Where to buy
- If you are willing to buy, you can buy it in forkdelta: https://forkdelta.github.io/#!/trade/0x357509df502c01db19e45d67d76a96be44d7592e-ETH
- However, I "strongly" recommend not to buy PRB token. I am pretty sure you will regret to buy this nothing-at-all token.

Thanks for your interest.
